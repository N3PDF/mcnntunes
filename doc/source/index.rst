MCNNTUNES: Tuning Monte Carlo generators with machine learning
=====================================================================

MCNNTUNES is a tool for Shower Monte Carlo generator tuning. It implements tuning methods based on supervised machine learning algorithms, specifically neural networks. The package includes procedures for automatic hyperparameter tuning and validation of neural network fits.
Machine learning capabilities are powered by `TensorFlow <https://www.tensorflow.org/>`_ and `pycma <https://github.com/CMA-ES/pycma>`_.
