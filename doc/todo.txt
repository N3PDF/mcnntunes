-Add list of refdata files and implement list of patterns and unpatterns  to match data (e.g. to exclude muons)
-Add possibility to weight each bin differently. 
-Run Pythia8 to get alternative theory input
-Interface to rivet to do the final plotting of the optimized model against refdata
-Check goodness by rerunning MC with optimized values of parameters
